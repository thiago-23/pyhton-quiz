# Design

The design of the Python Quiz Game is kept simple and follows a console-based interface. The terminal provides a straightforward way for users to interact with the application.

## Flowchart
A flowchart summarizing the structure and logic of the application is provided in the Flowchart section.

- The game keeps track of users choices in a Google Sheets setup. All users choices are gets saved. How does this magic happen? Well, a Google drive and Google Sheets working behind the scenes, connected the game through the Google Cloud Platform comparing the user input choices with answers sheet and calculate the score displaied on the game. So, users input are not just letter's; they're part of a high-tech adventure in the gaming world! ðŸš€

## Future Implementations
- Inclusion of various question levels
- Random selection of questions from a library
- Add a timer for each question, making the quiz more challenging.
- Create a leaderboard feature to showcase the highest scores achieved by users. This can add a competitive element and encourage users to improve their performance.
